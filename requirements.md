Prepare a short multimedia presentation that summarizes a military campaign or battle you are familiar with. Be sure to emphasize the principles of warfare you think are applicable in the campaign or battle you are presenting.

Don't feel that you have to be as formal with this as you might be in a business presentation – a bit of humor is always a plus.

Please give credit where credit is due for any graphics, music, or video that you use. This is a classroom presentation, so "fair use" rules apply – just give credit, try not to "over sample" any single source, and you'll be fine.
