## Preface

The _Battle of Gettysburg_ is commonly known to be the turning point of the Civil War.  It marked the last time the South
attempted an invasion of the North, and later led to the Gettysburg Address, one of the finest works of literature.

The overall three day battle is far too dense and complex for this assignment, so I have chosen to focus on the third day,
_Pickett's Charge_.

## A Tactical Genius

- Lee displayed "expert use of the Napoleonic turning movement as described by Antoine de Jo-mini".
- Goal was to bring the North to the peace negotiating table through costly defeats in Northern territory.
- "Became so engrossed with the tactical details and the possibility of achieving an Austerlitz 
that he lost his focus on directing a campaign linked to political ends."
- Sought to achieve a strategic and operational objective through a single tactical victory.

## The Prelude

- "began as an engagement between isolated units" that "escalated into a major battle which culminated in the outnumbered and defeated Union forces retreating to the high ground south of Gettysburg".
- Overall a very good victory by the South, despite how disorganized both sides were at the start.
- Following, Lee chose this ground to become _the_ battle where he would destroy the Northern forces.
